- **Splunk** — SPL queries with `stats count by index, sourcetype` aggregation
- **RSA NetWitness** — Native query syntax for packets, logs, and endpoint data

## Documentation

See the **[User Manual](USER_MANUAL.md)** for a complete guide covering all features, SIEM syntax details, the built-in Cheat Sheet, PWA install instructions, workflows, and troubleshooting.

## Usage

### Method 1: Direct Open
1. Download `index.html`
2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
3. Start building queries — nothing else needed

### Method 2: Local Server (PWA-enabled)
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then open http://localhost:8080
```
Serving via HTTP enables the PWA install prompt and service worker caching.

### Quick Start
1. **Select mode** — Single IOC or Bulk IOCs
2. **Choose IOC type** — or leave on Auto-Detect
3. **Pick SIEM platforms** — QRadar, Splunk, RSA NetWitness, Datadog SIEM, Wazuh (any combination)
4. **Enter your IOC(s)** — type, paste, or upload a .txt/.csv file — queries generate in real-time
5. **Copy and hunt** — click Copy buttons or press `Ctrl+Enter` to copy all
6. **Cheat Sheet** — click the Cheat Sheet button in the header for search query syntax reference

## Why Offline?

As a threat hunter, you often work with sensitive IOCs from active investigations. This tool:
- Never sends your IOCs over the network
- Runs entirely in your browser
- Has no analytics, ads, or tracking
- Can be used from an air-gapped workstation

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Areas for contribution:

- Additional SIEM platforms (Sentinel, Elastic, ArcSight, etc.)
- New IOC types (CVE, registry keys, file paths, etc.)
- Query template improvements and optimization
- Cheat Sheet expansions and additional hunting recipes
- UI/UX enhancements
