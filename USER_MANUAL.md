## Interface Walkthrough

The tool is organized into **4 step cards** displayed vertically:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SIEM Query Builder    [Dark Mode] [Cheat Sheet]  │  ← Header (always visible)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Select IOC Nature                      │
│  [Single IOC] [Bulk IOCs (up to 50)]    │
│  [Auto-Detect] [IP] [Email] [Domain]... │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Select SIEM Platform                    │
│  [IBM QRadar] [Splunk] [RSA] ...        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Add IOC Value                          │
│  [Input field or textarea]              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Generated Queries                      │
│  [Query output with copy buttons]       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Header features:**
- **Heading** — "SIEM Query Builder" in Consolas font with a typewriter animation on every visit
- **Dark Mode / Light Mode** — theme toggle button
- **Cheat Sheet** — opens an in-page search query reference for all 5 SIEM platforms

Queries regenerate **instantly** as you type, select options, or change settings — no "Generate" button needed.

---

## Single IOC Mode

Best for quick one-off lookups during an investigation.

### Steps:
1. **Select "Single IOC"** tab at the top of Select IOC Nature
2. **Choose IOC type** (or leave on Auto-Detect)
3. **Pick SIEM platforms** — check one or more (e.g., QRadar + Splunk)
4. **Enter the IOC** in the input field — the query appears in Generated Queries instantly

### Example:
| Input | Auto-Detected As | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `192.168.1.100` | IP | QRadar AQL, Splunk SPL, etc. |
| `user@evil.com` | Email | Mail-focused queries for each SIEM |
| `d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e` | MD5 | Hash-based hunting queries |

### Validation Feedback:
- **Green text** — IOC is valid and ready
- **Red text** — format doesn't match the selected type
- **Auto-Detect result** — shows what type was detected

---

## Bulk IOC Mode

Best for threat intelligence feeds, multiple IOCs from a report, or batch hunting.

### Steps:
1. **Select "Bulk IOCs"** tab
2. **Choose IOC type** — Auto-Detect is recommended for mixed IOCs
3. **Pick SIEM platforms**
4. **Paste IOCs** — one per line, up to 50
5. Review the validation table and generated queries

### Validation Table:
A color-coded table appears below the textarea showing each IOC:

| # | Value | Status | Detected Type |
|---|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | `192.168.1.100` | 🟢 OK | IP |
| 2 | `not-an-ioc` | 🔴 Invalid | ??? |
| 3 | `evil.com` | 🟡 Unknown | ??? |

- **Green dot** — valid IOC
- **Yellow dot** — unknown (select a type manually or use Auto-Detect)
- **Red dot** — invalid format

### Output Sections:

#### Individual Queries
One set of queries per IOC, organized by type and SIEM. Expandable `<details>` sections keep the output organized.

#### Chunked Combined Queries
IOCs of the same type are batched together using `IN` / `OR` operators:
- Adjustable **chunk size** (5, 10, 15, 25, or all 50)
- Each chunk generates one combined query per SIEM
- Useful for running fewer, broader queries instead of many individual ones

---

## File Import (.txt / .csv)

Instead of pasting, you can import IOCs directly from a file.

### Supported Formats:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.txt` | One IOC per line |
| `.csv` | Comma-separated — first column used as IOC value |

### CSV Handling:
- Multi-column CSVs: the tool extracts the **first non-empty value** from each row
- Values wrapped in quotes (`"192.168.1.100"`) are automatically cleaned
- Header rows are treated as values — **remove headers before importing** or delete them from the textarea after import

### How to Import:
1. Switch to **Bulk IOCs** mode (or the tool will switch automatically)
2. **Drag & drop** a `.txt` or `.csv` file onto the upload area
   — OR —
   Click **"Browse Files"** to select a file
3. IOCs are automatically parsed and populated
4. Review the validation table
5. A toast notification confirms how many IOCs were loaded

### After Import:
- You can still **edit** the textarea — add, remove, or fix IOCs
- Click **"Remove"** to clear the file and start over
- Max **50 IOCs** are imported (automatically capped)

## IOC Types & Auto-Detect

### Supported Types:

| Type | Format | Example | Pattern |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| **IP Address** | IPv4 / CIDR | `192.168.1.100`, `10.0.0.0/24` | `x.x.x.x` with optional `/yy` |
| **Domain / URL** | FQDN or full URL | `evil.com`, `https://malware-c2.com/path` | Contains TLD |
| **Email** | Standard email address | `user@evil.com` | `name@domain.tld` |
| **MD5** | 32 hex characters | `d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e` | `[a-f0-9]{32}` |
| **SHA-1** | 40 hex characters | `da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709` | `[a-f0-9]{40}` |
| **SHA-256** | 64 hex characters | `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb...` | `[a-f0-9]{64}` |

### Auto-Detect Mode:
- **On by default** — the tool guesses the IOC type from the value
- Best for **Bulk mode** with mixed IOC types
- If detection fails, manually select a type from the chips
- Detection priority: SHA-256 → SHA-1 → MD5 → IP → Email → Domain

### Manual Type Selection:
- Click any IOC type chip to force a specific type
- The tool validates all IOCs against the selected type's pattern
- Invalid IOCs show as **red** in the validation table

## SIEM Platforms & Query Syntax

### IBM QRadar
**Syntax:** AQL (Ariel Query Language)

Queries use `SELECT * FROM events WHERE ...` patterns with optional `LAST N DAYS` time windows. Includes separate queries for:
- Event data (`events` table)
- Flow data (`flows` table)
- Category-based filtering (mail category 16000, FIM category 7000, etc.)
- Payload search for deep inspection

### Splunk
**Syntax:** SPL (Search Processing Language)

Queries use `index=*` with field-based filters and `stats count by` aggregation. Output is sorted by count descending. Includes:
- Field-mapped searches (`src_ip`, `dest_ip`, `file_hash`, etc.)
- `stats count by index, sourcetype` for quick pivoting
- Pipe-chained commands for result refinement

### RSA NetWitness
**Syntax:** Native NetWitness query language

Queries use logical operators (`||` for OR) with specific attribute references. Includes:
- `ip.src`, `ip.dst` for IP hunting
- `file.hash`, `checksum` for hash lookups
- `alias.host`, `web.domain`, `dns.hostname` for domain/URL
- `mail.src`, `mail.dst` for email investigation

### Datadog SIEM
**Syntax:** Faceted log queries with `@attribute` notation

Queries target specific log attributes using the `@` prefix. Includes:
- `@src.ip`, `@dst.ip`, `@network.client.ip` for IP
- `@email`, `@usr.email`, `@mail.from`, `@mail.to` for email
- `@dns.question`, `@http.url`, `@http.host` for domain/URL
- `@file.hash`, `@file.hash.sha256` for hash lookups
- Service-scoped queries (`service:firewall`, `service:endpoint`, etc.)

### Wazuh
**Syntax:** Lucene / Elasticsearch field-based queries

Queries use field-based syntax compatible with the Wazuh indexer. Includes:
- `data.srcip`, `data.dstip` for IP with rule level filtering
- `data.email`, `email`, `mail.from`, `mail.to` for email
- `data.url`, `data.domain`, `url`, `domain` for domain/URL
- `file.hash`, `hash`, `sha256`, `md5` for hash lookups
- `rule.level>=10` for high-fidelity alert scoping
- `location:firewall`, `location:syscheck` for log source filtering

---

## Cheat Sheet

The **Cheat Sheet** is an in-page search query reference covering all 5 SIEM platforms. It's accessible from the header via the **"Cheat Sheet"** button.

### Opening the Cheat Sheet
- Click **"Cheat Sheet"** in the header — the main tool cards hide and the cheat sheet appears in their place
- The header (title + theme toggle + back button) remains visible
- Click **"← Back"** (the same button toggles) to return to the main tool

### Platform Selection
A **dropdown** at the top of the cheat sheet lets you switch between platforms:
- **IBM QRadar (AQL)** — SELECT syntax, tables, operators, string matching, functions, time, aggregation, grouping
- **Splunk (SPL)** — search basics, time modifiers, pipe commands, stats/eval functions, subsearches
- **RSA NetWitness** — native syntax, operators, attributes by category (IP/port/domain/email/file/user/process)
- **Datadog SIEM** — faceted syntax, @attribute reference, service/source scoping
- **Wazuh** — Lucene syntax, operators (incl. fuzzy, regex, proximity), rule-level filtering, location scoping

### Content
Each platform cheat sheet includes:
- Query syntax basics and operators
- Key field/attribute references for threat hunting
- String matching, regex, and wildcard patterns
- Time and date handling
- Aggregation and statistical functions
- Ready-to-use threat hunting query examples

---

## Copying Queries

### Individual Copy
- Hover over any query box — a **"Copy"** button appears in the top-right corner
- Click to copy that specific query
- The button briefly shows **"Copied!"** on success

### Copy All
- Click the **"Copy All"** button in the Generated Queries header
- Copies all generated queries from all SIEMs at once
- Queries are separated by blank lines for easy pasting

### Keyboard Shortcut
- **`Ctrl + Enter`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd + Enter`** (macOS)
- Copies all generated queries at once — fastest workflow for hunters

---

## Dark / Light Theme

The theme toggle button is in the top-right area of the header.

| Theme | Background | Accent | Best For |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Dark** (default) | Pure black (`#000`) | Light green | Late-night hunting, reducing eye strain |
| **Light** | White/gray | Blue | Daytime, well-lit environments |

- Your preference is saved to **localStorage** and persists across sessions
- If no preference is saved, the tool defaults to **dark mode**
- All colors, borders, shadows, and code blocks adapt to the selected theme

---

## PWA Support

The tool can be installed as a Progressive Web App for a native-like experience.

### Features:
- **Installable** — "Add to Home Screen" / "Install app" prompt in supported browsers
- **Standalone window** — no browser chrome, looks like a native desktop app
- **Service worker** — caches the tool for reliable offline use (when served via HTTP)
- **Custom icon** — "SIEM QB" branding in green-on-black

### How to Install:
1. Serve the tool via a local HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server 8080`)
2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in Chrome or Edge
3. Click the install icon in the address bar, or use the browser menu → "Install SIEM Query Builder"

The tool still works perfectly without installation — just open `index.html` directly.

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + Enter` / `Cmd + Enter` | Copy all generated queries |
| `Escape` | Close Cheat Sheet (legacy support) |
| `Tab` / `Shift + Tab` | Navigate between form elements |

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### Query Efficiency
- **Use Chunked Queries** for large batches — running 1 query of 10 IOCs is faster than 10 individual queries
- **Adjust chunk size** based on your SIEM's query limits — start with 10 and increase if your platform supports it
- **Select only the SIEMs you need** — generating queries for all 5 when you only use Splunk creates unnecessary output

### Cheat Sheet Usage
- Keep the **Cheat Sheet** open in a separate tab/window for quick syntax reference while hunting
- Switch between platform tabs to compare query syntax across SIEMs
- Use the threat hunting examples as templates — copy, paste, and customize

### IOC Hygiene
- **Deduplicate before pasting** — the tool doesn't deduplicate IOCs
- **Validate manually** — auto-detection is pattern-based; a valid-looking IP could still be benign
- **Remove headers from CSVs** before importing

### Hunting Workflow
1. Start with **Auto-Detect** to understand what types of IOCs you have
2. Switch to a **specific type** for validation and cleaner output
3. Use **Chunked Combined Queries** for the actual hunt
4. Reference the **Cheat Sheet** for platform-specific query syntax
5. Copy individual queries when you need to tune or share a specific search

### Security
- The tool runs **entirely in your browser** — no IOC ever leaves your machine
- Safe to use on **air-gapped** workstations
- No cookies, analytics, or tracking of any kind
- Verify queries before running them in production SIEM

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Queries not appearing** | Check that at least one SIEM platform is selected and the IOC is valid |
| **"Could not detect IOC type"** | Select the IOC type manually by clicking one of the type chips |
| **Too many invalid IOCs** | Check for extra spaces, quotes, or non-standard formats in your input |
| **File won't import** | Ensure it's `.txt` or `.csv` — other formats are not supported |
| **CSV import picks wrong column** | Reorder your CSV so the IOC column is first, or paste directly into the textarea |
| **Dark mode not saving** | Check that localStorage is not blocked (some private/incognito modes restrict it) |
| **Copy not working** | Older browsers may not support the Clipboard API — try `Ctrl+C` on the query text instead |
| **Cheat Sheet not loading** | Ensure the HTML file is intact — the cheat sheet is built into the same file |
| **PWA install not showing** | Must be served via HTTP — `python3 -m http.server 8080` then open `localhost:8080` |
| **Page looks broken** | Clear browser cache, ensure JavaScript is enabled, use a modern browser |
